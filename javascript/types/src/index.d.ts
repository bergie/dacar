/**
 * @module @reticulum/dacar
 * @description Dacar: Decentralized Access Control for Reticulum (JavaScript
 *   reference impl).
 *
 * A tuple-based, offline-first authorization policy plane built on an
 * LWW-Element-Set CRDT, designed for delay-tolerant mesh networks.
 *
 * Object and relation labels are stored only as salted HMAC-SHA256 hashes
 * (§3.3 Namespace Label Privacy), Threshold Groups may act as N-of-M Issuers
 * (§4.1), and the state is bounded by Time-Horizon Tombstone Pruning (§9).
 *
 * Exports the transport-agnostic core: HLCs, namespace hashing, tuples,
 * threshold groups, operations, verification, the §8 Challenge protocol, the
 * §11 DeltaReceiver, the CRDT, and the §6 authorization Engine. Reticulum
 * transports are opt-in via `@reticulum/dacar/transport`.
